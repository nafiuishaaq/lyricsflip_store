## Usage Examples

### Creating a Course
\`\`\`typescript
const course = await courseService.create({
  title: "Guitar Fundamentals",
  description: "Learn the basics of guitar playing",
  level: CourseLevel.BEGINNER,
  price: 99.99,
  instructorId: "instructor-uuid",
  tags: ["guitar", "fundamentals", "beginner"],
  learningObjectives: [
    "Master basic chord progressions",
    "Learn proper finger positioning",
    "Play simple songs"
  ]
});
\`\`\`

### Tracking Student Progress
\`\`\`typescript
// Enroll student
await progressService.enrollStudent(studentId, courseId);

// Complete a lesson
await progressService.completeLesson(studentId, lessonId, {
  timeSpentMinutes: 45,
  videoWatchTimeSeconds: 1800,
  exercisesCompleted: 5,
  score: 85,
  maxScore: 100
});

// Update overall progress
await progressService.updateProgress(studentId, courseId, {
  completionPercentage: 75,
  status: ProgressStatus.IN_PROGRESS
});
\`\`\`

### Generating Certificates
\`\`\`typescript
// Generate course completion certificate
const certificate = await certificationService.generateCourseCertificate(
  studentId,
  courseId
);

// Verify certificate
const verified = await certificationService.verifyCertificate(
  certificate.certificateNumber
);
\`\`\`

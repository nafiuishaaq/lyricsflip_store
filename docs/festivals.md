const performance = await scheduleService.createPerformance({
  artistId: "artist-uuid",
  stageId: "stage-uuid",
  startTime: "2024-07-15T20:00:00Z",
  endTime: "2024-07-15T21:30:00Z",

## Best Practices

### Scheduling
- Always check for conflicts before scheduling performances
- Allow buffer time between performances for setup/teardown
- Consider artist travel time between festivals

### Vendor Management
- Verify vendor licenses and insurance
- Coordinate vendor setup times
- Monitor vendor performance and customer feedback

### Attendee Experience
- Provide clear navigation and signage
- Offer accessibility accommodations
- Implement efficient check-in processes

### Analytics
- Track key metrics in real-time
- Generate daily reports for stakeholders
- Use data to improve future festivals

## Security Considerations

- All endpoints require authentication
- Role-based access control for different user types
- Sensitive data encryption
- Audit logging for important operations

## Performance Optimization

- Database indexing on frequently queried fields
- Caching for static data (maps, schedules)
- Pagination for large datasets
- Background jobs for analytics processing

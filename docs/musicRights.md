## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- `rights` - Main rights ownership table
- `copyright_registrations` - Copyright registration tracking
- `rights_transfers` - Rights transfer transactions
- `rights_conflicts` - Conflict detection and resolution
- `collection_society_reports` - Industry reporting

### Key Features
- **UUID Primary Keys**: All entities use UUID for better security
- **Comprehensive Indexing**: Optimized queries for common access patterns
- **JSONB Support**: Flexible data storage for complex structures
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Data integrity enforcement
- **Audit Trails**: Created/updated timestamps on all entities

## Installation

1. Add the rights module to your NestJS application:
\`\`\`typescript
import { RightsModule } from './modules/rights/rights.module';

@Module({
  imports: [
    // ... other modules
    RightsModule,
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
\`\`\`

2. Run the database migration:
\`\`\`bash
npm run migration:run
\`\`\`

3. The system is ready to use!

## Usage Examples

### Creating Rights
\`\`\`typescript
const rights = await rightsService.create({
  rightsType: RightsType.MASTER,
  ownershipType: OwnershipType.FULL,
  ownershipPercentage: 1.0,
  ownerId: 'user-uuid',
  trackId: 'track-uuid',
  territory: 'WORLDWIDE',
});
\`\`\`

### Transferring Rights
\`\`\`typescript
const transfer = await rightsTransferService.create({
  rightsId: 'rights-uuid',
  transferorId: 'current-owner-uuid',
  transfereeId: 'new-owner-uuid',
  transferType: TransferType.ASSIGNMENT,
  transferPercentage: 0.5,
  transferDate: '2024-01-01',
});

await rightsTransferService.execute(transfer.id);
\`\`\`

### Detecting Conflicts
\`\`\`typescript
const conflicts = await rightsConflictService.detectConflicts('rights-uuid');
\`\`\`

### Generating Reports
\`\`\`typescript
const report = await collectionSocietyReportService.generateReport(
  'performance',
  'ascap',
  new Date('2024-01-01'),
  new Date('2024-03-31'),
  'user-uuid'
);
\`\`\`

## Security Considerations

- All endpoints require JWT authentication
- UUID-based identifiers prevent enumeration attacks
- Comprehensive input validation using class-validator
- Transaction-based operations ensure data consistency
- Audit trails for all rights changes

## Industry Compliance

The system is designed to meet industry standards for:
- **ASCAP/BMI/SESAC** reporting requirements
- **International** collection society standards
- **Copyright Office** registration workflows
- **Music industry** best practices for rights management

## Documentation

Each service includes comprehensive JSDoc documentation. The system follows industry-standard practices for music rights management and provides a solid foundation for building music industry applications.

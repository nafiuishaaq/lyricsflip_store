## Usage Examples

### Creating a Label
\`\`\`typescript
const labelData = {
  name: "Awesome Records",
  description: "Independent electronic music label",
  website: "https://awesomerecords.com",
  email: "info@awesomerecords.com",
  defaultRoyaltyRate: 15.0,
  socialMedia: {
    instagram: "https://instagram.com/awesomerecords",
    spotify: "https://open.spotify.com/user/awesomerecords"
  }
};

const label = await labelsService.create(labelData, userId);
\`\`\`

### Creating an Artist Contract
\`\`\`typescript
const contractData = {
  artistId: "artist-uuid",
  startDate: new Date("2024-01-01"),
  endDate: new Date("2026-12-31"),
  royaltyRate: 20.0,
  advanceAmount: 50000,
  terms: {
    albumCommitment: 2,
    exclusivity: true,
    territories: ["US", "CA", "UK"],
    rights: ["recording", "distribution", "sync"],
    marketingCommitment: 25000,
    tourSupport: true
  }
};

const contract = await contractsService.create(labelId, contractData);
\`\`\`

### Creating a Release Campaign
\`\`\`typescript
const campaignData = {
  name: "Summer EP Campaign",
  artistId: "artist-uuid",
  albumId: "album-uuid",
  releaseDate: new Date("2024-06-15"),
  budget: 15000,
  strategy: {
    targetAudience: ["electronic", "house", "techno"],
    platforms: ["spotify", "apple-music", "beatport"],
    marketingChannels: ["social-media", "playlist-pitching", "pr"],
    goals: ["10k-streams", "playlist-placement", "blog-coverage"]
  }
};

const campaign = await campaignsService.create(labelId, campaignData);
\`\`\`

## Integration Points

### With Existing Modules

1. **Artists Module**: Contracts link labels to artists
2. **Music Module**: Campaigns can be linked to albums/tracks
3. **Analytics Module**: Label performance feeds into platform analytics
4. **Notifications Module**: Campaign updates and payment notifications
5. **Users Module**: Label ownership and team management

### External Integrations

3. **Campaign Metrics**: Budget utilization, task completion, ROI
4. **System Health**: API performance, database queries, error rates

## Future Enhancements

1. **AI-powered Analytics**: Predictive analytics for campaign success
2. **Automated Reporting**: Scheduled financial and performance reports
3. **Mobile App**: Dedicated mobile app for label management
